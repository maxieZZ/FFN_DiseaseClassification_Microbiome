# Applying Feed-Forward Neural Networks to Gut Microbial Abundance Data for Disease Classification

By Max Grice

## Abstract

As the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S, the continued rise of chronic conditions like cancer and irritable bowel syndrome (IBD) continues to prompt preventative efforts like early diagnosis and/or identification of prominent risk factors involved in disease progression. Since many of these diseases are partially characterized by modifications in composition and function of gut microbial species, understanding the link between our microbiome and disease onset may be helpful in informing early diagnosis and targeted treatment approaches. Due to the high dimensionality and complexity of data from the human gut microbiome, this investigation sought to determine the feasibility of deep learning approaches to predict disease states given microbial abundance data. Specifically, a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) was trained on 762 samples from patients that were classified as either Healthy, with Cancer, or with IBD. When compared to non-deep learning approaches like pixel similarity and linear modeling, the FNN approach was found to outperform all others with an accuracy of ~72% for cancer detection and an accuracy of ~85% for IBD detection. While these disease detection models require future improvements, the relatively high performance of the FNN compared to other approaches suggest that deep learning models should be studied more and are valuable in the context of microbial data and its role in disease progression.
